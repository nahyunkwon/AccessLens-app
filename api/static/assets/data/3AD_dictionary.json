If you want to <em>add more-extra-ultra grip</em> to the downside of the door stop you can <em>use a rubbercoating</em>. I tried the spray-on version of Plastidip and it works really great for this purpose.<br>\nFor your information, this is what I used: <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"http://www.plastidip.de.com/produkte/plasti-dip-flussiggummi/\">http://www.plastidip.de.com/produkte/plasti-dip-flussiggummi/</a><br>\nAnd best of it: you can remove the coating easyly if you don't like the result. Probably you can find something similar near you in some DIY store, hardware store, home improvement store or in a shop for car supplies. I found it in an electronics store.  </li>\n<li><strong>Buckled upside</strong> to hold the door in a firm and secure grip.  </li>\n<li><strong>Extra Big hole (~42mm diameter)</strong> with Extra smoothly rounded edges to pull it out comfortably with 2 Fingers or even with gloves.  </li>\n<li><strong>Safekeeping by hanging it over the handle</strong> of the door is possible for most doors due to the Extra Big hole. So you have it at hand in a door stop / self defense emergency.  </li>\n<li><strong>Easier slipping under the door</strong> even with a small gap to the floor, due to smoothly rounded tip and optimized design of the downside of the tip (reduced size of the first to teeth).  </li>\n<li><strong>Suitable for ~4mm-40mm gaps</strong> without scaling. (Just a guess based of the dimensions, to be verified in experiment. Could be up to 50mm max.)   </li>\n<li><strong>Wall and handle protector.</strong> Put it behind the door to avoid slamming the door against the wall. (Try it with the round end facing the door, too. Depending on the size of the handle and the character of the floor this can give better results.)  </li>\n<li><strong>Windows can be kept open with it</strong>, too. (Not talking about the software.)  Try to put it in the gap at the hinged side of the window.   </li>\n<li><strong>Optimized for easy printing on FDM machines</strong> (i.e. Ultimaker, RepRap,...). You should be able to print it without outer support, for details see the section instructions.  </li>\n<li><strong>Childsave.</strong> It is big enough that it can't be swallowed and does not have sharp edges. If you print it with the right material it is non toxic, too.  </li>\n<li><strong>Portable.</strong> It is light weight and has an Extra Big hole to grab and attach to things so it is really portable. If you want to transport it with your bike, you could just hang it around the handlebar. You could also attach a string and hang it around your neck for transport. If you transport it with your car you can attach a string to the hole and hang it around your rear mirror as an ornament, too.  </li>\n<li><strong>No assembly needed.</strong> It is just one piece so you don't have to worry about a difficult and time consuming assembly. It is usable right off the printbed.  </li>\n<li><strong>Customizable.</strong> You can add some rubber coating to the downside to adjust the grip needed to the floor and door you want to use.   </li>\n<li><strong>Nonlethal</strong> self defense tool. Hold it with two fingers in the Extra Big hole and just think about it. If you know what a tactical pen is, you know what I mean. Probably this is the first tool you have at hand when the Zombies try to rush into your home... <em>Update:</em> I thought about it again and probably this is not such a good idea, because the <em>Nonlethal Door Stop Multitool</em> is nonlethal and the Zombies are already dead. Seems not to match. You could instead try to impress them with your printing abilities and try to involve them into some kind of communication about it. (It is even more probable that a Zombie will communicate with you about 3D-printing than the <em>Nonlethal Door Stop Multitool</em> will do any serious harm to him or her...)  <strong>Caution: Update:</strong> As Gyrobot mentiond in the comment, there is a chance that the <em>Optimised Nonlethal Door Stop Multitool</em> could be <strong>lethal</strong>, too. You could bore someone to death with it. I wonder if this could work with the Zombie issue mentiond above....   </li>\n<li><strong>You can use it as an ornament</strong> by hanging it around your neck. The rappers hung alarm clocks around their neck in the '80s, so why not?  </li>\n<li><strong>You can use it to build a trap.</strong> Remove the handle of the door on the inner side, hold the door open with the door stop, attach a tripwire to the door stop. When somebody enters the room they release the door by the tripwire and the door closes. Works best with self-closing doors...  </li>\n<li><strong>Use it as communication enabler.</strong> Just put it on your desk at work. Somebody will ask what it is. And whoosh, you are right in the middle of a 3d-printing discussion. Don't forget to print the <em>Thing Tag</em>. Just in case you are asked...  <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"/thing:200571/attribution_card\">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:200571/attribution_card</a>  </li>\n<li><strong>Use it to test your 3d-printer.</strong> The Door stop is pretty easy to print, so the frustration factor should be minimal. And after printing you have something useful to play around with. And even if the print is not fully completed, it will probably work to stop a door. And failed prints tend to attract people, who ask you about it. A perfect print is good, but to induce communication a failed print is far better.  </li>\n<li><strong>Use it as door stop</strong> this is what it is intended to be. And it works pretty well for this purpose.  </li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Probably</strong> no one here reads so much text, so it seems not to matter so much what else I write here about the <strong>mere unlimited possibilities</strong> you have with this piece of plastics.

Calipers and good calibration are helpful for this, otherwise you may have to adjust and reprint.  You can also try terminating a test print early, and using the first few layers to check your measurement.  At the ideal size the nut and bolt sides will clamp together tightly right as it reaches the desired grip on the door knob.  If you aren't getting enough grip to your door knob, try adding a very thin strip of poster putty around the door knob before clamping the lever on.</p>\n<p>The example stl file is for a 54.9mm diameter door knob, and is designed to be held on with an M5x18 bolt and an M5 nut.</p>\n<p>Note: The OpenSCAD file uses my threading library for creating the properly sized recessed bolt and nut holes. <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"/thing:1686322\">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1686322</a>  The customizable version has the dependencies copied and pasted in since Customizer cannot yet load libraries.</p></div>\n",

Sometimes there's a deadly pandemic knocking about, and you're afraid of germs. That's where the Foot Door Opener comes in.</p>\n<p>Use this device to open doors with your feet. This works best in your home, not a workplace where heavy use could lead to breakage. Also not recommended for homes with small children.</p>\n<p>You will need:</p>\n<ul><li>8 feet of 1/8\" rope.</li>\n<li>Qty 8 of #8 or #10 screws, 3/4\" long.</li>\n<li>Gel superglue. I use Loctite brand.</li>\n<li>2 large rubber bands.</li>\n<li>4 zip ties, 6 inches or longer</li>\n<li>Gorilla tape or duct tape</li>\n</ul><p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Is your door knob Round-Style or Lever-Style? If Round, print the file 1of1DoorKnobHandle. If Lever-Style, you won't need this file.</p>\n<p>Print the files 1of2FootMechanism and 2of2FootMechanism.</p>\n<p>If you already have a lever style door handle, skip the following paragraph:</p>\n<p>Gather the two halves of the Knob Lever. Line the inside the halves with rolled-up Gorilla tape (to help reduce sliding) and place over your door knob. Depending on your door, the lever half may be on top or bottom. Secure each side with a zip tie. The tie slides through the holes. Refer to pictures. I slid my excess tie length back through the holes to prevent a sharp cut edge. If you like, you can tape over the ties to make the edges less sharp.</p>\n<p>Gather the parts for the Foot Mechanism. Refer to Assembly guide and glue parts together. Don't accidentally glue the round pegs where they need to turn.</p>\n<p>Affix the Foot Mechanism to close to the bottom of your door with the screws. Refer to video for placement ideas. </p>\n<p>Take your rope and tie one end through one of the holes on the foot mechanism. I just passed it through the top of the hole and tied a knot to keep it from slipping through. See pictures. </p>\n<p>Pass the other end of the rope through one of the holes on the Knob-Lever. I recommend trying the middle one first. Before you tie it off, turn the lever down as far as it will go. While holding it down, also hold down the Foot Mechanism as far as it will go. This is the length you want. Mark the rope and tie off the top. It may take several tries to get the tension just right. If you are using a Lever style door handle, you can just tie the rope around the lever and tape it. </p>\n<p>Turn the knob on the other side of the door both directions. Make sure the Foot Mechanism goes up and down and does not prevent the door from opening when someone turns the other knob upward. If that happens, try a different hole in the Knob Lever. </p>\n<p>Use the hole in the other side of the foot mechanism to tie a rubber band. Pass the other side of the rubber band through the small hole in the bottom of the mechanism. You want the tension to keep the sliding mechanism in its resting middle position. The rubber band prevents the mechanism from getting stuck at the top of its arc.</p>\n<p>Press your foot down on the mechanism to open the door. To close the door, place your foot on the bottom part of the mechanism (not on the rotating part.)</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any questions or if any of this is confusing. </p>\n<h1>NoTouchChallenge</h1></div>\n",

Armie promotes people to use their arms to open doors, as the user is less likely to transmit the virus using this method. </p>\n<p>The device is designed to fit on most handle profiles, however, we are aware it may not fit onto all handles. Armie requires a minimum of two cable ties to successfully secure the 3D print to the handle.

This thing is a 5th generation prototype suitable to release for others to use. Its large and one side has a grip hole for bottle tops around 30mm diameter and the other for 40mm. For me this covers every drink bottle I get, water, softdrink, milks, fruit juices. The inner grips angle inward so slip over and down onto most bottle tops easily for grip regardless of the texture on the bottletop lids. The outer shape is large and overal slightly oval shaped so it provides a good comfortable shape to get a grip on for easy turning. I printed with hard PLA and its great, flexible filaments may offer more grip and comfort. The PLA has stood up to heavy duty dishwasher action so should be safe for you. There is a hole through the middle too if you want to hang it on a hook or if a lid gets stuck in the grip you can poke it out from the otherside with your finger.</p>\n<p>Very handy for anyone with hand/grip difficulties such as arthritis or stroke sufferers.

Voil\u00e0 the pop can is open with barely any force required!<br><br></p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>This project started out as a gift for my mother and was a complete success. It has a long way to go, though. While this pop can opener works great and doesn't need a whole lot more tweaking, it's only the beginning. I want this design to inspire new similar designs with a focus on simplicity, inexpensiveness, and ease of use. There's no moving parts, no unnecessary fanciness (although early versions of the design had both of these), it's a simple solution that just works. I plan on continuing to come up with similar designs and I hope everyone who sees this can be inspired to pursue a similar line of thought when coming up with tools for those with arthritis/prosthetics.<br><br></p>\n<h4>Video</h4>\n<p><a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJjQBzp0JBQ\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/NJjQBzp0JBQ/0.jpg\"></a></p></div>\n",

Neither requires support. Be advised that the tolerances are quite tight and mounting the handle on the can and the brush holder on the handle will require some persuasion. The handle mounts by hooking the outboard barb on the inside rim of the can and then with heavy pressure rotating the inboard barb over the outside rim until it snaps into place. Next the bottom of the handle is attached to the lower rim by pushing downward and inward simultaneously. It is recommended that you install and remove the brush holder a few times to get things loosened up a bit (beware of elephant's foot) and then install the handle without the brush holder, installing the brush holder last. The brush holder is designed for a brush with a 10mm ferrule. You can adjust the gap to be larger or smaller using a hair dryer/heat gun. </p>\n<p>If you are installing this on a can which is full of paint.... good luck. I'm betting you'll have a mess on your hands. It is recommended that you empty the can before installation and refill it once CanHandlePlus is successfully installed. Removing the CanHandlePlus is quite a bit easier and it should be possible, with some care, to remove it from a partially filled can.</p>\n<p>By the way, keep your rim trim and free from paint with the QT_RimTrim (<a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"/thing:5932062\">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5932062</a>)</p>\n<p>Here's a short video demonstrating installation:<a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HCgX8A0RXlA\">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HCgX8A0RXlA</a></p>\n<p>This design is for a U.S. quart paint can. I'm not sure if all paint cans are identical so here are the dimensions of the can I used:  108mm outside diameter, 80mm inside diameter,  14mm rim width, 123mm high rim to rim.  I have included the Fusion 360 files if you need to make adjustments.</p></div>\n",

Positioned correctly this subtle little helper maintains the distance between the Chop Sticks at the control / pivot point as well as minimizes side movement without affecting rotational movement (...required to grab food)  </p>\n<p>Many people struggle with using Chop Sticks, particularly if you don't use them often to get in practice, so this  handy little slide on alignment helper could be just what you need. \"Cheat Sticks have been designed to let you use Chop Sticks as they are meant to be used (i.e. The lower Chop Stick stays still and the top Chop Stick rotates up and down around a pivot point at the centre of your thumb). 'Once located correctly Cheat Sticks' minimises the sideways movement of your Chop Sticks... keeping them under control.   </p>\n<p>Just slide 'Cheat Sticks' onto your regular pair of Chop Sticks to the point where you want your thumb located (approx. 2/3 of the length up from the tips). Hold the Chop Sticks in the correct way and your 'Cheat Sticks' will help keep them aligned as you use them.   </p>\n<p>Most Chop Stick Helpers I've seen change the way Chop Sticks work because they either make them springy when moved from the neutral point or they link them at the top so turn them into giant tweezers. 'Cheat Sticks' are different in that they let you move your Chop Sticks in the correct way without any springy effect. They just help keep your Chop Sticks aligned.   </p>\n<p>Tips for use:  </p>\n<p>As Chop Stickers vary in size make sure you position your 'Cheat Sticks' at the point they still allow free rotation but minimize side movement (i.e. Locating 'Cheat Sticks' too far down the taper of the Chop Sticks will reduce their effectiveness as they Chop Sticks will be have increased potential to move sideways).  </p>\n<p>If your Chop Sticks are very thick or thin you can adjust the Z-scale prior to printing to ensure a snug fit can be achieved to minimize sideways movement of the Chop Sticks. The standard file has been developed to suit most 'common' size Chop Sticks (6.75 to 7.25mm at the wide end).  </p>\n<p>Rest your thumb on  'Cheat Sticks' to hold it in place but also try and keep the tip of your thumb so it can touch the top (moving) Chop Stick. This can further help with control.  </p>\n<p>This is a quick and easy print that uses very little filament. Refer to the instructions and print some and try them out!  </p>\n<p>Note: If you like this check out all my other designs.   </p></div>\n",

Then align the flat on the bar with the slot in the other loop and firmly push. Be careful, especially if you have poor layer adhesion as the loop may break and require a reprint.</p>\n<p>4: The cover should now be captive between the rings, but swing-able on the hinge.

To get the toast out people have been known to try all sorts of things that can result in burns or, even worse, an electric shock.  </p>\n<p>You can buy wooden tongs to do a similar thing but they go down the sides of the toast so can get very close to or damage the toaster elements. Because they are made of wood, over time they can also get burnt from the hot metal surfaces, albeit better than your fingers getting burnt. And, they are quite expensive for what they are,   </p>\n<p>The design incorporates a rotating joint so the arms can swing in/out to suit the width of the piece of toast. This could have been made to spring open, so force required to narrow them, but that meant additional pressure would be required to securely grab the toast not to mention a loss of feel. The Toast Extractor is not springy so it needs very little pressure to pinch onto the toast and lift it out.   </p>\n<p>This is a one piece print with independently moving parts. No support required. With a well set up / accurate machine you should only have to give the joint a gentle 'wiggle' after printing for it to come free and start rotating easily.   </p>\n<p>Refer to images and print instructions for more information.   </p>\n<p>Note: If you like this check out all my other designs!   </p>\n<p>The 'Toast Extractor' is your solution...  </p>\n<p>Rather than being inserted into the toaster between the toast and elements the 'Toast Extractor' grabs the sides of the toast.

Young Andrew Forest was unable to comfortably grasp a fork with his right hand, so he used modeling clay to shape a special handle for his fork.  His mom baked the assembly in the oven to make it rigid enough for Andrew to use.  This seemed like such a good idea that we wondered if Andrew\u2019s invention would be useful for other people with hand differences.  So we used Tinkercad to develop the fork handle for 3D Printing.  </p>\n<p>The design fits a fork available from the Dollar Tree store in a 2-pack for $1.   Do not use PLA filament (so that the assembly can be washed in a dishwasher).  The STL file allows for the shrinkage in ABS and Nylon.  For flexible material like Cheetah or rigid filament that does not shrink, try a version that is scaled to .9 on the x-axis in your slicer.  A ziptie can be used to secure the fork in the handle.  </p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a 3D printer, try getting a quote from <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"https://www.3dhubs.com/\">3D Hubs</a> or <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shapeways.com/create\">Shapeways</a> or do a google search on 3D printing services with your zipcode.  </p>\n<p>Feel free to hack or remix the design to make it fit your fork better.  You can start with the <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"https://tinkercad.com/things/8FhTJmZYqSw\">Tinkercad File</a>.

Young Andrew Forest was unable to comfortably grasp a fork with his right hand, so he used modeling clay to shape a special handle for his fork.  His mom baked the assembly in the oven to make it rigid enough for Andrew to use.  This seemed like such a good idea that we wondered if Andrew\u2019s invention would be useful for other people with hand differences.  So we used Tinkercad to develop the fork handle for 3D Printing.  </p>\n<p>The design fits a fork available from the Dollar Tree store in a 2-pack for $1.   Do not use PLA filament (so that the assembly can be washed in a dishwasher).  The STL file allows for the shrinkage in ABS and Nylon.  For flexible material like Cheetah or rigid filament that does not shrink, try a version that is scaled to .9 on the x-axis in your slicer.  A ziptie can be used to secure the fork in the handle.  </p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a 3D printer, try getting a quote from <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"https://www.3dhubs.com/\">3D Hubs</a> or <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shapeways.com/create\">Shapeways</a> or do a google search on 3D printing services with your zipcode.  </p>\n<p>Feel free to hack or remix the design to make it fit your fork better.  You can start with the <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"https://tinkercad.com/things/8FhTJmZYqSw\">Tinkercad File</a>.  Or do what Andrew and other e-NABLE volunteers are doing and develop some other assistive devices for other tasks.

Many people don\u2019t even think how hard it can be to get on your socks, if you can\u2019t get down to your feet. I first recognized that, when I visited my grandma. She can still do it herself, but it is very difficult, especially as she is ill right now and doesn\u2019t feel that well. But on the other hand she also doesn\u2019t want help (it is also a part of freedom, if you can get dressed yourself and also when you want)</p>\n<p>I designed the Sockinator to help people to put on their socks or stockings themselves or for their day keepers to make it easier.

I used a M2.5 screw and nut.</p>\n<p>I recommend printing these on their side, with the flat L shape of the handle against the bed and the key oriented vertically. That will let you print with minimal (or no) supports. Use a relatively high infill percentage for durability since it will be taking torque on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>I've also included the fusion 360 files so you can modify it to suit your needs. Alas, Past Rowanon didn't use good design principles so it may be easier for you to start from scratch anyway.</p>\n<p>Modeled from scratch but inspired by dma678's design. That's the first key turner I've seen with the lever, which is a bulky but game changing addition. I wanted something that fit the keys a bit better and kept them from wiggling around in the holder. </p></div>\n",

Armie promotes people to use their arms to open doors, as the user is less likely to transmit the virus using this method. </p>\n<p>The device is designed to fit on most handle profiles, however, we are aware it may not fit onto all handles. Armie requires a minimum of two cable ties to successfully secure the 3D print to the handle. There is a left and right-hand version of the Armie, please print according to which side of the door your handle is situated. Installation instructions on how to install Armie can be found within the project folder.</p>\n<p>Together we can help prevent the spreading of COVID-19.

They broke where they are hinged(when the oven door hit them).  So this design can be removed and set on the counter, then reinstalled.  I first tried to make it with pieces that snapped together, but the fit wasn't good enough to stop it from being removed by a child.  I then switched to the current design with threads and it seems to fit just right.  This seems strong enough for a young child, but out of PLA it can be broken by force.
